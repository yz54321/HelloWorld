Who are those little girls in pain<br>
just trapped in castle of dark side of moon<br>
Twelve of them shining bright in vain<br>
like flowers that blossom just once in years<br>
<br>
<br>
They're dancing in the shadow like whispers of love<br>
just dreaming of place where they're free as dove<br>
They've never been allowed to love in this cursed cage<br>
It's only the fairy tale they belive<br>
